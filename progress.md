# Project Progress

## Overview
A React/Vite single-page experience has been enhanced to showcase a generative Email Campaign flow for Klaviyo. The page now simulates an AI agent crafting an email campaign step-by-step while guiding the viewer through each stage.

## Completed Work
- **Generative flow orchestration**
  - Added a cascading, three-stage build (Email Composer → Recipients → Schedule & Send) in `public/2-klaviyo-agent-ui-animated.html`.
  - Implemented Knight Rider loading animations with per-section auto-scroll and precise 2s timing.
  - Ensured the submit button locks into a red "stop" state while generation runs and reverts only after completion.

- **Content & layout polish**
  - Migrated the static email composer mock-up, recipient form, and scheduling tiles into the animated layout.
  - Preserved the GitHub Pages-friendly asset structure by keeping static HTML files inside `public/`.
  - Normalized user vs. agent messages (`.user-message` and `.agent-message` styles) for clarity.

- **Agent panel enhancements**
  - Added a ChatGPT-style prompt area with a circular submit button.
  - Introduced a completion summary that streams (typewriter effect) inside the agent panel, including bold formatting, emojis, and action guidance.
  - Auto-scroll keeps the most recent agent output visible.

- **Deployment & tooling**
  - Confirmed `npm run deploy` pushes the locally built `dist/` folder via `gh-pages`.
  - Documented the behavior so the workflow is clear (local build → deploy → optional git push).

## Current State
- Published animated page at `public/2-klaviyo-agent-ui-animated.html` with fully functional cascading generation.
- Main branch and GitHub Pages deployment (via `gh-pages` branch) are up-to-date as of the latest commit `3234f03`.
- Source tree contains both the original static HTML (`2-klaviyo-agent-ui.html`) and the new animated variant for comparison/testing.

## Next Ideas (Optional)
- Add true cancellation logic when the stop button is clicked (clear timers, reset UI).
- Expand the agent message streaming effect to intermediate responses for a fully conversational feel.
- Parameterize timings (loader duration, scroll offsets) so product/design can tweak interactions without editing code.
